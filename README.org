* Description

After using Spacemacs for couple of days, I realized that the Spacemacs which is out of box doesn't suit me.

What I need is to learn Emacs from the original state.

Let me restart the repository belonging to myself!


* Process

  - Learning...
  - Turn to spacemacs...
  - Back to pure emacs
